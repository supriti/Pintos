Pintos is a simple operating system framework for the 80x86 architecture. It supports kernel threads, 
loading and running user programs, and a file system, but it implements all of these in a very simple way. 
In the Pintos project, we have added support in all three of these areas. We have also added a virtual memory 
implementation.
